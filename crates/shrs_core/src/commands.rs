//! Command queue for mutating `States` and `Shell` in handlers
//!
//! Commands can be pushed into a queue in handlers
//! and will be run directly after it ends.
//! `Commands` is stored in `Shell`, which can be accessed in handlers.
//! ```rust
//! pub struct C{}
//! fn add_state(sh:&Shell){
//!    sh.run_cmd(|sh:&mut Shell, states: &mut States|{
//!        states.insert(C{});
//!    });
//! }
//! ```
//! Functions with the correct signature automatically implement `Command`.
