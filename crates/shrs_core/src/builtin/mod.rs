//! Builtin commands
//!
//! The main difference between builtin commands and external commands is that builtin commands
//! have access to the shell's context during execution. This may be useful if you specifically
//! need to query or mutate the shell's state. Some uses of this include switching the working
//! directory, calling hooks or accessing the state store.
