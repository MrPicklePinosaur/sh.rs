Plugins are a way to add addition functionality that may be opinionated or heavy to **shrs** in a modular fashion. **shrs** comes with a couple officially maintained plugins, which you can see in the [plugins directory](https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/shrs/tree/master/plugins).

Some examples of official plugins are:

- `shrs_output_capture`: add a builtin called `again` that will output the result of the previous command
- `shrs_prompt_builder`: configure your prompt using the builder pattern
