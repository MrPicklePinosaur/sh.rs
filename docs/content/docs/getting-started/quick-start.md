### Prerequisites

To get started with using **shrs**, you need a functioning Rust installation.
To install Rust, you can use the [rustup](https://rustup.rs/), the Rust
toolchain installer. You will also need **cargo**, the Rust package manager.

Finally, you will need some basic knowledge on how **Rust** works, if you are
still new to **Rust**, you can consult the [rust
book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/).

### Create Cargo project

Create your own shell project using cargo:

```sh
cargo new <project-name>
cd <project-name>
```

Next, add shrs as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`. shrs is still currently in pre-release, so there will be frequent updates. You can use the most recently published version with:

```toml
shrs = { version = "0.0.5" }
```

Otherwise, if you wish to be on the bleeding edge, you can depend directly on the master branch (beware that there may be unexpected bugs and breaking API changes on master):

```toml
shrs = { git = "https://github.com/MrPicklePinosaur/shrs" }
```

### Building the Shell

Next, you can create a basic shell using all of the **shrs** provided defaults with the following:

```rust
use shrs::prelude::*;

fn main() {
    let myshell = ShellBuilder::default()
        .build()
        .unwrap();

    myshell.run();
}
```

Now to run the shell

```sh
cargo run
```

From here we can start digging into all the potential configuration and
extensions that can be applied to **shrs**. See the next section for details.
